/// with the platform's own settings, in the profile's website data store and
/// with its Space's content rules, and the platform's web view, which the
/// page's owner then hosts. It keeps each profile's store itself: a private
/// page's profile, and every profile of a launch that keeps nothing on disk,
/// lives in a store of its own in memory, which goes when the core erases the
/// profile, as private browsing ending does; any other profile opens its
/// store on disk. It runs each load the core asks for in the page, once the
/// page's host is ready for it. A page the core closes keeping its state hands
/// the core WebKit's history and the address it shows, which the tab's next
/// page brings back in place of its first load; a popup and a private page
/// keep nothing. The owner tears the web view down when it releases the page.
/// Each page tells the binding when its media starts or stops, so the page
/// reports the media it runs to the core as that changes. The questions a
/// page's document asks go to the core, which the page's host shows the
/// person, and come back as the core settles them. The files its pages
/// download run as WebKit's own downloads, which it reports to the core. It
/// erases what WebKit keeps for a profile when the core asks, whether or not
/// any page of it opened this run.
