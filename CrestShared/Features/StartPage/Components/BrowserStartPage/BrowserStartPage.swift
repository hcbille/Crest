/// branding, the focus request its address field raises, the
/// ``BrowserStartPagePromotion`` that grows that field into the palette, and
/// the window's commands.
///
/// The tab is named explicitly rather than read off the Space because Split
/// View renders one of these per card, so the surface cannot assume it is
/// speaking for the selected tab. Every action still routes through
/// `BrowserCommandPaletteActionPolicy`, which answers "unavailable" for a card
/// that is not the focused one.
