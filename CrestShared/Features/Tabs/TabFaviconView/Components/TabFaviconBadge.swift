/// The mark a tab's icon wears in its bottom-trailing corner: the engine its
/// page runs on.
///
/// The mark sits on a disc of the window's ground, ringed by a hairline,
/// rather than on the icon: a favicon can be any colour, and the mark's own
/// colours carry it only against a plain ground. A sidebar row and a pinned
/// tile draw it at the same size, hung off the same corner, so pinning a tab
/// changes nothing about how it is marked. The disc is sized against the row's
/// 18pt favicon, the smaller of the two, so it never grows into the icon it
/// annotates.
///
/// Drawn over the favicon after the tab's residency fade, so the mark keeps
/// full strength on a tab the shell no longer holds in memory.
///
/// The badge says nothing to VoiceOver. A tile is one button and a row is a
/// container with one labelled button in it, and both write their value from
/// outside, so anything declared in here would be merged away or read twice.
/// Whoever draws a badge adds what it means to that value instead.
